## Team Contributions

**Kyle Shiroma (Team Lead)**  
- Led project direction and coordinated team meetings  
- Designed and implemented the backend Python script for:  
  - De-identification of patient data  
  - Integration with OpenAIâ€™s LLM for summary generation  
- Connected backend to the R Shiny UI using `reticulate`  
- Built the PDF export pipeline with `rmarkdown` and custom formatting

**Amine**
- Built UI (Frontend) with R Shiny
- Built multilingual function 

**Mikhaela**
- Helped analyze data and merge the 3 original datasets into one
- Performed an EDA, noting that oxygen levels are no longer supported/reported in 2025, allowing for accuracy comparison in LLM summary generation

**Tommy**
- Got OPENAI API Key
- Wrote python script draft

**Ryan** 
- Supported me in tying the backend of R Shiny web from python
